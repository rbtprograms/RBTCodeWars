PROBLEM DOMAIN: validate pin numbers, only allowing 4 OR 6 digits, but not 5. Make sure they are all numbers.

SOLUTION: Worked with Injoong. It went great, we knew right away we need to do regex and we did, it didn't take us long at all! It was a bit hard figuring out the proper notation for either 4 OR 6 digits but not 5, but we got it done.
